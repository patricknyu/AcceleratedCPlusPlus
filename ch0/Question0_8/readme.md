...and this one?

	#include <iostream> int main()
	{
	// This is a comment that extends over several lines
	// by using // at the beginning of each line instead of using /* // or */ to delimit comments.
	std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;
	return 0; 
	}

This is valid.  All the stuff for the entire line after each // starts is a comment, so none if it is interpreted.

The rest of the program is valid.
